# RFID_Based_Tag_Reader
In this project I have used RFIO-RC522 sensor and LCD_I2C with Arduino Mega
**** #include <MFRC522.h> library file i used to interface arduino with RFID ****** (Download from arduino IDE itself)

Connections 
*RFID-RC522 CONNECTIONS*
SDA - PIN 53
SCK - PIN 52
MOSI- PIN 51
GND - ANY ground pin
RST-  PIN 5
POWER (3.3V) - 3.3V

*LCD I2C CONNECTIONS*
GND - GND
VCC - 5V
SDA -PIN 20
SCL -PIN 21


Dump the code as such and let me know if anyone is getting errors
